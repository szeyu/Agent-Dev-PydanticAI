## Getting Started

### Setting up the Environment

Before running the code in this repository, you need to set up a Python virtual environment:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

> **Note**: Always make sure the virtual environment is activated before running any code from this repository.
