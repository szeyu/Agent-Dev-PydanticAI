    "- Each node represents a discrete step in our workflow\n",
    "- Data flows through the system in a well-defined manner via the State object\n",
    "- Dependencies between steps are explicitly modeled as graph edges\n",

    "This approach offers several advantages over traditional sequential programming:\n",
    "- Modularity: Each component has a single responsibility, making the system easier to understand and maintain\n",
